## A note about Flair  ##

So I believe Flair is going down in flames, and here is why:

> All the top developers of the company have cashed-out and left. I'm talking about the one's that were truely passionate about the product and being able to create something new and more open to the public. *** notice how the hacker side of the company appears to be gone? The lack of insights and updates on the inner workings of the device?

> The "creator" Dan has set himself on a new mission statement of slashing every expensive at the cost of a quality product; for example the original Flair Pucks has this great tactile feel and goals to make full use of the selected chipsets to the cheap feeling piece of shit it is today.  Its pretty sad to see the complete lack of shits this person gives for a quality product and instead taking the company down to an employee size that cannot meet the needs and assistance of its customer base.

> There is zero QA testing done on these products and devs now rely on the support team to filter everyday support tickets for the current bugs in the code/hardware. Up until 2020 there wasn't even testing of the FLair App on Android... it was literally only tested on iOS.

> New managment of Support team is truly fucking awful. Like a bag of flaming shit riding on top of a rotten skunk awful. They seem to be more interested in raising their own salary up than building up a proper team and promoting within.

> Flair has not posted one job listing on their website for over 2 years now while having a totally inadequate team for all aspects of the company. They literally have ~10 people working to keep this "way too old to still call themselves a start-up" company functioning properly.


With all this said I have decided to release the collection of info I have so the pubilc isn't totally fucked and some real creativity will come from this hardware.
